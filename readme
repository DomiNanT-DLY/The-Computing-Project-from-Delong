Libraries required to install before running the chatbot:
    1) from tensorflow
    2) from flask
    3) from keras
    4) from nltk
    5) from numpy

Due to Github's upload size limit, I can't upload the venv folder, which contains all the virtual environment related script, but it is not a big problem, 
since you can reimport then.
